<li>Join the membership for discounts on fruit (1st of month) and vegetables. You can register for membership AFTER making a purchase - no minimum purchase, but you do need a purchase.

<li>The most expensive. Watch out for buying meat: they have low turnover of product because their main customers are tourists, and not all tourists have access to kitchenettes. Take a good sniff after you purchase meat and make sure it isn't rotten.</li>

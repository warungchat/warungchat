    <h1>Water</h1>
    <p>Tap water is not safe to drink or cook with, even when boiled. The vast majority of the water supply is <em>sumur bor</em>, or bore (drilled) well water. Even when the water is supplied by PDAM, it is probably also sumur bor.</p>
<p>Mineral water can be easily bought at marts, supermarkets, and can be delivered to your home by a water delivery service.</p>

    <h1>Airport arrival tasks</h1>

    <main>
    <h2>Before arriving</h2>
<h3>Airport assistance</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can arrange for VIP airport service to meet you immediately after immigration, at the bottleneck just before customs and Duty Free. This is probably only useful if you think you will struggle with luggage, going through customs, and finding your pre-arranged airport driver.
<ul>
<li>The only legit service appears to be through a company called <a href="https://joumpa.com/">Joumpa</a>, which is <a href="https://gapura.id/about-us-uk">an offshoot of Garuda Indonesia</a>. You can purchase Joumpa's services through <a href="https://joumpa.com/">their own website</a> and also through <a href="https://www.traveloka.com/en-en/activities/indonesia/product/joumpa-airport-vip-service-bali-dps-2000218378860">Traveloka</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>48h (or less) before arrival:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fill in customs declaration and take screenshot of QR code</li>
<li>Fill in health declaration and take screenshot of QR code</li>
<li>For non-tourists: register mobile phone IMEI and take screenshot of code
<blockquote>
<p>December 2024 note: registration currently produces a text code made up of letters and numbers, but no QR code. I showed this screenshot to the IMEI registration office and was told that the online system doesn't work.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>After arriving at the airport</h2>
<h3>Luggage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Collect luggage. If your luggage has been flagged as unusual in the airport luggage scanners, it will come off the luggage belt with a bright orange zip tie attached tightly to each handle.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Immigration</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tourist visa on arrival (VOA):
<ul>
<li>Method 1: Line up to pay for visa, and then line up again to go through immigration.</li>
<li>Method 2: Apply and pay online for e-visa, and then go through autogate.
<ul>
<li>If you have paid online for your VOA, you should have received a PDF file with a barcode to use at the e-gate. You SHOULD be able to use this at the e-gate, but it can be finicky. On the left-hand side of the e-gates is an entrance into the regular line, in case your e-gate attempt fails.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Employment visa, or entering on a temporary employment pass: Go through the <strong>Special Lane</strong> that is around the same area as the tourist e-visa payment counters. You can go through the long tourist line, but the immigration officer will probably chuckle and ask why you didn't go to the Special Lane.</li>
</ul>
<p>After immigration, if you hired Joumpa: between Immigration and Duty Free, you will see them holding up an iPad with your name on it.</p>
<h3>Customs</h3>
<ol>
<li>Show customs declaration QR code to customs desk. They will scan it.</li>
<li>Bring your luggage through customs. You will have to put your luggage through luggage scanners - yes, even though they already scanned the checked luggage before it came off the luggage belt.
<ul>
<li>If your luggage has been flagged with bright orange zip ties, you will be asked to go through a different customs section on the left. You will scan your luggage, and then you will be asked to open up your luggage for inspection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Mobile phone registration</h3>
<p>This office is located after customs. Mobile phones valued under 500 USD can be registered for free. Customs will look up the value of your phone on their computer system. They will then register the IMEI numbers of your phone - your phone may have 1 or 2 IMEI numbers, depending on if it has dual sim, esim capabilities, etc.</p>
<h3>Currency exchange and ATM withdrawal</h3>
<p>The airport rates aren't as good as in town, of course. However, in town, you will need to be careful with getting your ATM numbers skimmed, or with sleight-of-hand currency exchange tricks.</p>
<ul>
<li>ATM cash withdrawal: use an ATM <em>inside</em> a bank, to minimize the risk of getting your card skimmed.</li>
<li>Currency exchange: use authorised money changers only. These are ALWAYS in standalone shops that almost look like banks. A currency exchange that is part of another business or run-down is probably a scam. Always look up reviews of the money changer on Google Maps beforehand, and make sure that there are MANY positive reviews.
<ul>
<li>An example of a legit currency exchange is BMC Sanur <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/75B6phhAS4UD9N9F7">(üó∫Ô∏èGoogle Maps)</a>, between Icon Mall and Sindhu Night Market</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Buying a tourist sim</h3>
<p>You can easily buy a tourist sim card at the airport. Telkomsel has the widest coverage, which is useful for rural areas. You will need your passport to register for a sim card.</p>
<h3>Getting an airport transfer</h3>
<p>The last section of the airport is a long line of taxi drivers etc waiting to pick up customers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid hiring a taxi tout on the spot, because you will most likely be overcharged. The taxi touts are able to hang around the airport all day waiting for a mark because of how much they overcharge.</li>
<li>Pay for airport transfer ahead of time through websites such as Klook or Traveloka</li>
<li>Walk past the taxi touts. Ignore them and let them move on to the next mark. Go to the Grab or Klook lounges to wait for your ride. There will also be staff on hand to help you learn how to book a ride through these apps.</li>
<li>Average costs from the airport, Jan 2025:
<ul>
<li>Canggu:</li>
<li>Nusa Dua:</li>
<li>Sanur:</li>
<li>Seminyak:</li>
<li>Ubud:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

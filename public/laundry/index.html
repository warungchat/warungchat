    <h1>Laundry</h1>
    <h2>Laundry services</h2>
<ul>
<li>Due to the amount of tourists around, it is easy to find places that will do laundry by the kilogram.</li>
<li>Clothes are dried by tumble dryer. Some places will have a line drying option available.</li>
<li>Prices range from Rp 10-20,000 per kg. You may be able to pay a little more for express service (completed within 1 hour, or a few hours).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Laundry products</h1>
<p>You can get pretty much any laundry product: liquid detergent, detergent sheets, detergent pods, softener, stain remover, etc. However, it will most likely be in a refill-style plastic bag. If you want it in a hard plastic container, you will need to buy that separately. Some examples on Tokopedia and Lazada:</p>
<p>Depending on how much you need, you can buy laundry products in soft plastic packets of around 5 mL, 15 mL, 500 mL, and 1 L.</p>
<h2>Detergent</h2>
<h2>Softener</h2>
<p>Most softeners are advertised as &quot;perfume&quot;, which consists of fragrance + softener.</p>
<ul>
<li>The big laundry perfume brand is Kispray, and it is also the most expensive. The packaging advertises it as a 3-in-1 <em>pelicin, pewangi, dan pelembut</em>, which translates as smoothener/lubricant, perfume, and softener.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Softergent</h2>
<p>There is a product type called &quot;softergent&quot;, which is a combined detergent and softener. It almost always has a fragrance.</p>
<h2>Fragrance-free laundry products</h2>
<p>Trickier to look for, but available.</p>
<h2>Stains</h2>
<p>Most of the water supply is <em>sumur bor</em>, or bore (drilled) well water. The iron content can fluctuate, resulting in light yellow/brown stains on clothing. It can be helpful to add a water filter to your washing machine's water supply hose.</p>

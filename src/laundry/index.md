## Laundry services

- Due to the amount of tourists around, it is easy to find places that will do laundry by the kilogram.
- Clothes are dried by tumble dryer. Some places will have a line drying option available.
- Prices range from Rp 10-20,000 per kg. You may be able to pay a little more for express service (completed within 1 hour, or a few hours).

# Laundry products

You can get pretty much any laundry product: liquid detergent, detergent sheets, detergent pods, softener, stain remover, etc. However, it will most likely be in a refill-style plastic bag. If you want it in a hard plastic container, you will need to buy that separately. Some examples on Tokopedia and Lazada:

Depending on how much you need, you can buy laundry products in soft plastic packets of around 5 mL, 15 mL, 500 mL, and 1 L.

## Detergent



## Softener

Most softeners are advertised as "perfume", which consists of fragrance + softener. 

- The big laundry perfume brand is Kispray, and it is also the most expensive. The packaging advertises it as a 3-in-1 *pelicin, pewangi, dan pelembut*, which translates as smoothener/lubricant, perfume, and softener.

## Softergent

There is a product type called "softergent", which is a combined detergent and softener. It almost always has a fragrance.

## Fragrance-free laundry products

Trickier to look for, but available.

## Stains

Most of the water supply is *sumur bor*, or bore (drilled) well water. The iron content can fluctuate, resulting in light yellow/brown stains on clothing. It can be helpful to add a water filter to your washing machine's water supply hose.

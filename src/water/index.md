Tap water is not safe to drink or cook with, even when boiled. The vast majority of the water supply is *sumur bor*, or bore (drilled) well water. Even when the water is supplied by PDAM, it is probably also sumur bor.

Mineral water can be easily bought at marts, supermarkets, and can be delivered to your home by a water delivery service.
